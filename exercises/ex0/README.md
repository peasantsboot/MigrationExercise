# Prerequisites for the Migration Exercises

After having finished the assessment of the current SAP Process Orchestration landscape and having estimated the effort needed to migrate with the Migration Assessment capability, the next step is the actual migration. The goal of the Migration Tool is to provide a semi-automated migration where interfaces in Cloud Integration will be automatically created so ideally 60-70% of technical migration efforts are automated. The migration of scenarios is based on a pattern approach, the suitable pattern is applied and the required flow steps are added to create the final integration flows.

## Create an Integration package

As a prerequisite, you first need to create an integration package where the automatically generated integration flows are created. If you have already run through other exercises before, you may have already created an own package. In this case, you can simply reuse the other package and skip the steps below.

1. If you are not already in the SAP Integration Suite landing page, switch back to the landing page by clicking on the SAP sign.
